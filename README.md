# Memory-saving-spreadsheet(Excel)
This project involves creating an efficient data structure representing a spreadsheet while minimizing the required rows and columns allocated. The program also provide necessary functionalities to manipulate the contents of the spreadsheet.

A key aspect of this project is to support dynamic operations, such as adding and removing rows and columns. These operations will involve updating the pointers of the affected cells to ensure the integrity and consistency of the spreadsheet structure. By implementing these dynamic operations, the program will offer flexibility in modifying the size and shape of the spreadsheet as needed.
